            <h2>Studying in Italy</h2><br>
            <img src="/images/Random-13.jpg" class="pragraph-photos" alt="Studying abroad, Studing Italy, Experinces Devin Cetin">
            <p>I studied Master's degree in Italy. It was a great adventure for me. I always loved Italy. Only the culture itself is mesmerizing. I spent three years in Italy. It was a great experience for me. I had very colourful friendships. We
              used to cook for each other, and have cocktail parties and outdoor sports.</p>

            <p>One of the main draws of studying in Italy is the opportunity to immerse yourself in a new culture. From learning the language to exploring the country's museums and landmarks, studying in Italy offers endless opportunities for
              personal growth and enrichment. Specifically in Rome, Everything is like an open museum. Most of the time, you discover something new. After a point, it draws you. Because you feel like you have to see everything and in a city like
              Rome, there is no end. You can never be satisfied with what you have seen. The city is huge and it’s impossible to see everything in one visit. Rome is an ancient city that has been around for centuries, so there are endless things to
              discover and learn about. It’s definitely worth your time if you want to study abroad in Italy.</p>

            <p>Italy is also home to some of the world's oldest and most prestigious universities, including the University of Bologna and the University of Padua. These institutions offer a wide range of courses and degree programs, from art and
              design to business and economics. My university was Sapienza University. It is a good university with a good ranking. However, the English accent was a disadvantage for me. Because I had a hard time understanding the Italian professors.
              I can't say I didn't learn anything. I have really good lectures and lecturers.</p>

            <p>Another perk of studying in Italy is the chance to travel throughout Europe. With its central location, Italy is a great starting point for exploring neighbouring countries and experiencing different cultures. Plus, with budget
              airlines and train systems, travel within Italy and Europe is often affordable and accessible.
              Of course, studying in Italy isn't without its challenges. One potential hurdle is the language barrier. While many Italians speak English, it's important to have at least a basic understanding of Italian to fully immerse yourself in
              the culture and make the most of your experience. I start Italian courses in CPIA. It is a government Italian course for immigrants. It is not the best one of course but it was free. So with all my friends, we start this course. I
              wasn't so focused on the Italian classes. The teacher was really nice but I had a Master's degree, a waiter job...</p>

            <p>As soon as I moved there, I start working in an Irish Pub. Because I had to work. It was a job with late night shifts and very hard at the moment because my apartment was extremely far away. I managed to find only that job. Later on, I
              had a scholarship as well. In the beginning, I couldn't manage to apply for the scholarship before the deadline. Overall, It was a nice experience for me because I met many people from different countries. But this work is totally for
              another blog.</p>

            <p>Another challenge can be adjusting to a new academic system. Italian universities may have different grading systems and teaching styles than what you're used to, so it's important to do your research and prepare accordingly. Most of
              the time, You don't understand If it is good great or bad. What is the average score in the class? Who is the best one? You will be lost among those questions. You only should focus on passing the exam.</p>

            <p>Overall, studying in Italy is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that offers both academic and personal growth. Especially for personal growth. You will learn and experience many different things. Overall, I was very stressed because I
              couldn't find my dream job. But when you look at the aspect of having fun and focusing on the beauty (things that I can't manage to do easily), It is definitely a must to do. If you're considering studying abroad, add Italy to the top
              of your list!</p>

            <h2>Finding a Job in Italy</h2><br>
            <img src="/images/Random-52.jpg" class="pragraph-photos" alt="devin cetin porta portese job blog">
            <p>I studied Master's degree in Italy. I lived there for almost 3 years. Despite the disadvantages, I loved living there. From day one, I start looking for jobs in my field. As a non-native Italian, finding a job in Italy can be a
              daunting task. I have faced numerous difficulties in securing employment. Employers often prioritize native speakers, even when the job does not necessarily require it.</p>

            <p>First of all, I studied Communication and management. I know it is not the best practice to find a job in a foreign country. Because basically, you have to speak the language. Specifically, I tried to find a marketing position. I did
              my best to improve my skills and learn Italian. But in Italy, employers mostly look for a native speaker. In the different fields, the situation is different. I accept in my field finding a job is difficult in every country. For
              example, it is easier to find a position in computer science, engineering etc. Because basically, they speak job-related languages. </p>

            <p>Additionally, navigating the Italian job market can be confusing and overwhelming. There are many bureaucratic hurdles to overcome, and the process can take much longer than expected. This is particularly challenging when you are
              living in a foreign country and trying to establish yourself.</p>
            <p>Despite these challenges, I remain determined to find employment in Italy. I am committed to improving my language skills and networking with professionals in my field. I believe that my unique perspective as a non-native Italian can
              bring valuable diversity and creativity to any workplace. I applied for jobs as soon as I started my Master's degree. I tried to find simple jobs to earn some money. I looked for positions at the university. Because I heard there were
              some part-time positions. But then I found out all of them were only in Italian. Of course, then I start applying for waiter jobs in the tourist areas in Rome. I thought they must have been speaking in English. I was right about it. I
              started working in an Irish pub.</p>

            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CqDAe7PoKWQ/"></a> <img src="/images/Random-54.jpg" class="pragraph-photos-left" alt="devin cetin porta portese instagram blog">
            <p>Of course, I can't say that it was what I have been dreaming of. However, It was a great experience. I am not just saying that but I learned about foreign consumers. It has improved me somehow. But I have to say that I wasn't expecting
              to work there for almost 2 years. It wasn't a solid 2 years. I got lucky sometimes and I found other positions in marketing and I worked remotely. But like I said I was lucky to find those. I can say that after that many years of job
              searching, I basically know who hires only with English in Rome. Yes, of course, they reject me. </p>
            <p>All my Italian friends kept telling me "You should try Milan, Milano", and "They hire ex-pats". I applied for millions of positions in Milano as well. All I got was scammers and very very bad positions. I have to explain one of them.
              One of the employers called me directly and said " you applied for that position, we want to meet with you and discuss it". I said, "Great, let's schedule a meeting". They said let's meet this Saturday. It is odd but okay. Then we met
              remotely. There was a guy who is smoking, and he said "I don't speak English, my friend will connect in a second, he speaks". He connected and he was in the car and tried to speak with me. He basically said that "Normally, we were
              working with an American company but we don't at the moment. We will start working with another American company but I don't know anything at the moment so I can't explain the job.". I said, "Okay, I understand. But at least, money,
              contract, how I will work, what is the position, what I will do etc.". He said, "I can't tell you anything but there is no contract no salary only commission" and I said, "goodbye". After that day, I stop applying for jobs in Italy.</p>
            <p>Needless to say, It is really hard to find a job in my field without Italian. I didn't even meet with the people in my situation who finds jobs. I am just an example. It might be my bad luck. In the end, I hope that Italy will
              recognize the talents and potential of non-native speakers like myself and provide more opportunities for us to contribute to the workforce.</p>

            <h2>AI for Marketing</h2>
            <img src="/images/DALL·E_AIinMarketing.jpg" class="pragraph-photos" alt="Marketing AI in marketing DALL.E">
            <p>I don’t think the world needs one more AI article or blog, but I have things to say as well. Everybody knows it and it is not that hard to learn because it learns for you. Artificial Intelligence, even Microsoft starts doing it. I
              guess they started some time ago, but it is never late. In this article, yes let’s call it an article, I will explain AI marketing techniques that may be useful for some of us. </p>

            <p>First of all, I need to tell you that I wrote my thesis on “AI in Organizational Communication”. I mostly explained AI methods that have been used in Communication mediums. I mainly gather my argument along with the marketing
              techniques. When I was writing my thesis there wasn’t Chat GPT, so I proudly can say that I didn’t use it to write my thesis. But this is not the question anymore. The question is “Would it be even better even I would write it with Chat
              GPT?”.</p>
            <p>Marketing is one of the most affected by AI tools. Using AI in Marketing is not such a new thing. AI has been tried many times in market research with real data to track consumer preferences and behaviours. There are many examples like
              “AI predicted that X consumer going to buy this product and that happened”. Machine Learning makes the magic. If you train the AI with as much data as you can, It will be stronger. With the recent updates in the AI field, people are
              using it every minute and AI keeps learning. As far as I remember, AI used to be good at numbers but not so efficient with text. Nowadays, with Chat GPT 4, It is even understanding memes and jokes.</p>
            <p>I have to accept, before writing this article, I asked Chat GPT for some suggestions. Even with too many typos you can understand it is me because I only ask for some suggestions about the general structure. I ask it to analyse my
              website and my content and give me some examples according to them. It does a brilliant job. I used the Google sheet Chat GPT extension to do it. It is more convenient and It looks more professional.</p>
            <p>For example, Chat GPT told me to start with “By 2025, the global market for AI in marketing is expected to reach $13.4 billion” to highlight the importance. There are many investments in this field because it is affecting everything.
              It is easy to use now, everybody can learn… Besides that, Open AI was an open source. They were a non-profit company. Their goal was to unleash the power of AI for all Humanity. AI is truly a power. Open AI tries to eliminate unfair
              competition. They were successful as well. However, in 2020, they became a for-profit. Microsoft bought some shares, and they are becoming bigger.</p>
            <p>In marketing, AI found a huge usage area. You can do branding, market research, content marketing, online marketing, social media marketing etc. You can even find marketing strategies, create photos, and directly promote photos. In the
              early stage of this technology, like IBM Watson studio, you could use machine learning techniques to predict future consuming activities or classify text contents like consumer feedback. It was very limited and it wasn’t entirely
              successful in the text format. Of course, it could generate basic bar charts or suggestions according to the entered data. The data was mostly the one that you enter. However, AI can browse through the internet and find more
              personalized and accurate answers for you.</p>

            <h3>AI tools for Marketers</h3>
            <p>Nowadays, There is too many AI tool for Marketers to increase work quality and decrease the time spent. I will try to list some trending AI tools that Marketers can use in their work professionally.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, the use of AI in marketing is becoming increasingly popular and essential for businesses of all sizes. With its ability to predict consumer behaviour, generate personalized content, and streamline marketing processes, AI
              is a powerful tool for marketers. Thanks to recent advancements, AI can now even understand jokes and memes, making it even more adaptable to the constantly evolving digital landscape. There are numerous AI tools available for marketers
              to use, such as Pebbly.com for branding, Validatorai for business ideas, and Durable for website building and online marketing. Additionally, Google Sheets Chat GPT extension, Copy.io, and Notion.ai are all great tools to help generate
              content and streamline the content creation process. As AI continues to evolve, it will be exciting to see how it will transform the marketing landscape even further.</p>
            <p>In the end, AI is not a magical solution for everything. You should know what you are doing. At least you should know how to start. You should know how to use them quickly because it is an opportunity for every size of business. As a
              marketer, I am worried but on the other hand, those tools are for me and I can use it. It might take our business or it might make everything easier. There are many ethical dilemmas. I still think that even if you are using them, you
              have to have a strategy and idea about what you need and how you should do it. I know Chat GPT can give those answers but It is up to you to personalize those answers. I don’t know who but someone says that “ You can find the answers
              but this is the era of knowing how to ask better questions.”</p>
